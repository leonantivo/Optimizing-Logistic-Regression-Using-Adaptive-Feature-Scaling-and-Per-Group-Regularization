## Optimizing Logistic Regression Using Adaptive Feature Scaling and Per-Group Regularization

This repository contains the source code for the research paper "Optimizing Logistic Regression Using Adaptive Feature Scaling and Per-Group Regularization." The code demonstrates a novel approach to enhancing logistic regression performance by integrating Adaptive Feature Scaling (AFS) and Per-Group Regularization (PGR).

### Research Overview

The project addresses the limitations of applying uniform preprocessing and regularization strategies to heterogeneous datasets. The core methodology involves:

1.  **Adaptive Feature Scaling (AFS)**: Grouping features into logical categories and applying a tailored scaling method to each group (e.g., `StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`, `RobustScaler`).
2.  **Per-Group Regularization (PGR)**: Applying different regularization penalties (L1 or L2) to each feature group during model training.

This dual-optimization approach is designed to improve model robustness, predictive accuracy, and interpretability, particularly on datasets with diverse feature types.

### Code Description

The provided Python script `optimized_logistic_regression.py` implements the AFS and PGR methodology using the `scikit-learn` breast cancer dataset as a demonstration.

#### Key Steps in the Script:

1.  **Dataset Loading**: The `load_breast_cancer` dataset is used, as it provides a readily available, well-understood benchmark.
2.  **Feature Grouping**: The 30 features of the dataset are logically divided into three groups to simulate different semantic types:
      * **Group 1 (Indices 0-9)**: Simulates a demographic-like feature set.
      * **Group 2 (Indices 10-19)**: Simulates a financial-like feature set.
      * **Group 3 (Indices 20-29)**: Simulates a behavioral-like feature set.
3.  **Adaptive Scaling**:
      * Group 1 is scaled with `StandardScaler`.
      * Group 2 is scaled with `MinMaxScaler`.
      * Group 3 is scaled with `RobustScaler`.
4.  **Per-Group Regularization**:
      * A `LogisticRegression` model with **L2 regularization** (`penalty='l2'`) is trained on the combined features of Group 1 and Group 2.
      * A second `LogisticRegression` model with **L1 regularization** (`penalty='l1'`) is trained on the features of Group 3.
5.  **Ensemble Prediction**: The prediction probabilities from both models are combined and averaged to produce a final, robust prediction.
6.  **Evaluation**: The script calculates and prints key metrics (Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC AUC) on the test set to demonstrate the model's performance.

### Mathematical Formulation

The core of our approach is the composite regularized cross-entropy loss function:

$$L(w) = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ y_i \log(\sigma(w^T x_i)) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \sigma(w^T x_i)) \right] + \lambda_1 \|w^{(1)}\|_1 + \lambda_2 \|w^{(2)}\|_2^2 + \lambda_3 \|w^{(3)}\|_2^2$$

Where:

  * $w^{(i)}$ represents the weight vector for feature group $i$.
  * $|w^{(1)}|\_1$ is the L1 norm for Group 1 (or other sparse groups).
  * $|w^{(2)}|\_2^2$ and $|w^{(3)}|\_2^2$ are the L2 norms for the other groups.
  * $\\lambda\_i$ are the group-specific regularization parameters.

### Setup and Running the Code

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
    ```
2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git
    cd your_repository_name
    ```
3.  **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python optimized_logistic_regression.py
    ```

### Results

The script will output the performance metrics of the combined model:

```
Accuracy: 0.9825
F1 Score: 0.9818
ROC AUC: 0.9983
```

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the AFS and PGR approach on the breast cancer dataset, showcasing a high-performing and well-generalized model.
